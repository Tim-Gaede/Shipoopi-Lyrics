Well, a woman who'll kiss on the very first date
Is usually a hussy
And a woman who'll kiss on the second time out
Is anything but fussy

But a woman who'll wait till the third time around
Head in the clouds, feet on the ground
She's the girl you're glad you found
She's your shipoopi

Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi
But you can win her yet

Walk her once just to raise the curtain
Then you walk around twice and make for certain
Once more in the flower garden
She will never get sore if you beg her pardon

Do re mi fa so la ti
Do ti la so fa mi re do

Squeeze her once, when she isn't lookin'
If you get a fqueeze back, that's fancy cookin'
Once more for a pepper-upper
She will never get sore on her way to supper

Do re me fa so la ti
Do ti do

Now little ol' Sal was a no-gal
As anyone could see
Lookit her now - she's a go-gal
Who only goes for me

Squeeze her once, when she isn't lookin'
If you get a squeeze back, that's fancy cookin'
Once more for a pepper-upper
She will never get sore on her way to supper

Do re me fa so la ti
Do ti do

Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi
But you can win her yet

Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi
The girl who's hard to get
Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi
But you can win her yet, shipoopi
